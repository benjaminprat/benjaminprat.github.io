## Overview & Goals
 Fan Site is a static site using HTML & CSS for the subject matter of my choice. I chose my favorite musical artist, Spoon. 

## Technologies 
* HTML
* CSS
* GitHub & Github Pages

This project was developed on macOS Big Sur 11.1 and tested in Chrome browsers, but does not require the user to install any software.

## Visuals & Accessibility 

### Desktop View

On load the user is presented a page which contains a short bio of the band, a list of their albums and three YouTube videos. When hovering over the image in the navigation bar, the image transforms to a larger size. When the image is clicked, the user is redirected to the band's official website.


### Tablet View

The application can be viewed on a tablet.

### Mobile View

The site can also be viewed on mobile devices. When the user hovers over any of the list items, the font color changes from black to white. 

### Accessibility

The site passes accessibility audits for both Lighthouse and Wave, ensuring best practices. 

## Wins
* While I have a limited amount of CSS experience, I was able to implement CSS Grid  in my layout design. 
* With so many users accessing sites and applications on mobile devices, I decided to explore responsive design and was mostly pleased with the outcome. 
## Challenges
* The responsive design is not as polished as I would like, but I will continue to work on this in a future iteration. 
* I was unable to change the positioning of the videos under their respective headings in the responsive design.
